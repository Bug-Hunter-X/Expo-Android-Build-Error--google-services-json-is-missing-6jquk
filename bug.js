This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the following error message: 

`Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`. > File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services JSON file is missing from the android folder of your project. This is necessary for using Firebase or other Google services.`,

This is a common error, but it can be tricky to debug because the cause isn't always obvious.  Sometimes the file is present but not correctly linked.
