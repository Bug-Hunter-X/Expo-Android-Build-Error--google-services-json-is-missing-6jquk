The solution involves ensuring the `google-services.json` file is present in the `android/app/` directory of your project.  If it's not there, you'll need to download it from your Firebase project settings.  Once you've added the `google-services.json` file, ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` correctly includes the `google-services` plugin:

```gradle
//In your android/app/build.gradle
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'

...

dependencies {
    // ...other dependencies
    implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.2.3"))
    implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics")
}
```

Then, run `expo prebuild` and `expo build:android` again. This should resolve the error.
